# Airbnb Clone Project (FullStack App)

### üéØ Feature Breakdown

  **1. User Management**
Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. Authentication ensures only authorized access to personal data and actions.

  **2. Property Management**
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings, providing detailed information and setting rental prices. This enables a flexible and dynamic hosting experience.

  **3. Booking System**
Users can book properties for specific dates, with automatic conflict checks and reservation status tracking. This forms the core transactional functionality of the platform.

  **4. Payment Processing**
Secure payment handling allows users to pay for bookings using integrated payment services. Each payment is tied to a specific booking to ensure traceability.

  **5. Review System**
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties after their stay. This promotes transparency and trust among users and hosts.

  **6. Asynchronous Tasks**
Tasks such as email confirmations or notifications are handled in the background using Celery, improving performance and user experience.

  **7. API Security**
Security measures like token-based authentication and input validation are implemented to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

  **8. CI/CD Integration**
Automated testing and deployment pipelines ensure code quality and speed up the development process with consistent builds and rollouts.
