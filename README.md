#### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A well-designed booking system is crucial for success. It reduces friction in the user journey, which can significantly increase conversion rates and improve customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and a responsive design ensure that users can easily find and book properties, leading to a positive and trustworthy experience.

#### Figma Design Specifications
Understanding the design properties of a mockup is essential for translating a design concept into a functional user interface. It ensures that the final product matches the designer's vision in terms of aesthetics, branding, and user experience.

    * **Primary**: `#FF5A5F`
    * **Secondary**: `#008489`
    * **Background**: `#FFFFFF`
    * **Text**: `#222222`
    * **Secondary Text**: `#717171`

* **Typography**:
    * **Primary Font**: Circular, Medium (500), 16px
    * **Headings**: Circular, Bold (700), 24px-32px
    * **Secondary Text**: Circular, Book (400), 14px

### üèóÔ∏è UI Component Patterns
Planning reusable UI components is key to maintaining a consistent look and feel while streamlining development. Each component will be designed for reusability and consistency across the application.

#### Planned Components
* **Navbar**:
    * Logo
    * Search bar
    * User navigation (login, signup, profile)
    * Responsive menu for mobile devices
* **Property Card**:
    * Property image carousel
    * Basic details (price, location, rating)
    * Favorite/wishlist button
    * Responsive layout for different screen sizes
* **Footer**:
    * Site links (About, Careers, Help)
    * Company information
    * Social media links
    * Copyright information

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Design

#### Key Entities and Fields

* **User**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `created_at`
* **Property**: `id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `description`, `price_per_night`
* **Booking**: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`
* **Payment**: `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`, `payment_date`
* **Review**: `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`

#### Entity Relationships

-   A **User** can own many **Properties**, make many **Bookings**, and submit many **Reviews**.
-   A **Property** belongs to one **User** and can have many **Bookings** and **Reviews**.
-   A **Booking** is linked to one **User**, one **Property**, and one **Payment**.
-   A **Payment** is made for one **Booking**.

### üîê API Security

To ensure data protection and system integrity, several backend security measures are implemented:

* **Authentication**: Verifies user identity using token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).
* **Authorization**: Restricts access to actions based on user roles (e.g., only property owners can edit their listings).
* **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Prevents injection attacks (SQL, XSS) by cleaning and validating all user input.
* **Rate Limiting**: Protects against brute-force attacks by limiting the number of requests per user.
* **HTTPS Enforcement**: Ensures all data is encrypted during transmission.

---

### üîÅ CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines automate testing and deployment, reducing human error and speeding up the release cycle.

#### Benefits:
* Ensures code is thoroughly tested before deployment.
* Automates repetitive tasks like running unit tests, linting, and building.
* Promotes faster feedback and collaboration.

#### Tools:
* **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows for testing and deployment.
* **Docker**: Ensures consistency across development and production environments.

### ‚úÖ Best Practices

* **Code Organization**: Maintain a clean, modular code structure for readability and maintenance.
* **Version Control**: Use feature branches for new development and write meaningful commit messages.
* **Responsive Design**: Follow a mobile-first approach to ensure the application works on all devices.
* **Accessibility**: Adhere to WCAG guidelines to make the application usable for everyone.
* **Documentation**: Keep all project documentation, including this README, updated.
* **Testing**: Implement a comprehensive testing strategy with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
